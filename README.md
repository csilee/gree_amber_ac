# Gree AC Custom Component for Home Assistant
Disclaimer: because I'm lazy, this README.md was mostly generated with ChatGPT.

This integration is basically the official Gree integration modified to disable the audible feedback beeps from the air conditioner unit, thanks to a patched [greeclimate](https://github.com/namezys/greeclimate/tree/beep_disable) library from [@namezys](https://github.com/namezys).

## Features

- Control your Gree AC units directly from Home Assistant.
- Enjoy a quieter experience with the beeps disabled.
- Simple installation process with HACS.

## Differences from Official Integration

The functionality of this custom integration is essentially the same as the official Gree integration provided by Home Assistant. However, it includes a patched version of the `greeclimate` library, which disables the beeps from the unit, providing a more serene environment.
